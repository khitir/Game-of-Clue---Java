For our tests, we made sure to select rooms with a variety of
door directions. For example, the X room has an UP door, the Y
room has a DOWN door, the Z room has a LEFT door, and the 
A room has a RIGHT door.

We also tested to make sure that the label cells and center cells
were functioning properly, as well as the secret passageways and
walkways.
